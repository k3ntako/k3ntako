      <p>
        A website for dragon boat team coaches to manage their teams.
        The website allows coaches to create events and boat line-ups, manage their roster, view each individual's attendance, and much more.
        Team members can response to events to let the coach know if they are attending, send emails to the team, receive reminders to respond to events, and much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wakebird was developed with a teammate from my dragon boat team.
        We have routine video conferences to discuss future plans.
        I review his PRs to assure prevent bugs and maintain a high standard of code quality.
        This experience has pushed me to write better code, exposed me to new technologies, and improved my communication skills and my ability to read and comprehend others{"'"} code.

      <p>
        A website for finding and reviewing the best (or worst) cafes for studying.
        I noticed that neither Google nor Yelp offered consistent data on whether a cafe was suitable for doing work.
        A user can search for the cafes near them in our database and their results will be displayed on Google Maps.
        Currently, I have scrapped data for Starbucks around NYC and they can be reviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is currently in development, and there are areas needing improvement.

        Manabu tries to bring studentsâ€™ studying needs into one place.
        It allows users to create flashcards, take notes, and set reminders.
        Additionally, the homepage offers the user upcoming reminders, the weather, and current news.

        This was built as my final project at Launch Academy.

        A website for discovering and reviewing video games.
        The goal was to help users make purchasing decisions and allow them to share their experiences.

      <p>
        5th Dimension uses the Google Books API to allow users to search for books.
        A user can view relevant information about each book, such as title, author, book cover, and a link to Google Books.
        The homepage offers users the top six books from the fiction New York Times Best Sellers list as inspiration.
        The user can activate dark mode from the nav bar for viewing at night, and localstorage caching reduces the number of calls to the NYTimes API.
